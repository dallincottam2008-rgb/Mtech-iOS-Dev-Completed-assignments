//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF09: "Distance Between Points"
//  Concept: Practice converting mathematical formulae into Swift functions and working with doubles.

//  Instructions:
    //  Create a function that finds the distance between two points on an x,y plane.
    //  The function will take in 4 paramaters as doubles (x1,y1,x2,y2)
    //  It will return the distance as a double
    //  Most likely you do not know the formula for finding the distance between two points. Google it.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Create a struct called "Point" that holds the x and y values of each point, then use instances of Point to calculate the distance.
