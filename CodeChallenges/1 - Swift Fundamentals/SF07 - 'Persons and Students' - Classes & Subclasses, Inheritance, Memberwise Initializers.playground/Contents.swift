//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge SF07: "Persons and Students"
//  Concept: Practice creating classes, using inheritance to create subclasses, and creating initializers

//  Instructions:
    //  Under each step below, write the required code.

import Foundation

//  1) Create a Person class
    //  Include a name, age, weight, and favoriteColor properties


//  2) Create a Student class
    //  This class inherits from Person.
    //  A student also has a currentClass, a grade, and a gpa property


//  ⌺ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Create a third class called Teacher.
    //  Include a reasonable set of properties.
