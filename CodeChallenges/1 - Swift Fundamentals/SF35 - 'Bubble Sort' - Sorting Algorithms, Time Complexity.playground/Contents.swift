//  🏔️ MTECH Code Challenge SF35: "Bubble Sort" 🫧
//  Concept: Learn about sorting algorithms and build one of the simpler, though less efficient ones; gain a brief introduction to sorting algorithms and time complexity

//  Instructions:
//  Create a function that takes in an array of Ints.
//  You are to sort this array without using the built in .sort() method.
//  Implement a bubble sort. A visual example of what a bubble sort is is shown here: 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#/media/File:Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif
//  Return the sorted array
func bubbleSort(_ array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var returnArray = array
    var totalCount = array.count
    
    for index in 0..<totalCount{
        for num in 0..<(totalCount - index - 1) {
            let leftNum = returnArray[num]
            let rightNum = returnArray[num + 1]
            
            if leftNum > rightNum {
                    returnArray.swapAt(num, num + 1)
                    print(returnArray)
                }
        }
    }
    return returnArray
}

print(bubbleSort([9,2,6,8,1,3,5,4]))
//  Examples:
//  Input: [15, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 45, 12]
//  Output: [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15, 45]

//  ⌺ Black Diamond Challenge:
//  Sorting algorthims are implemented by Swift under the hood so that you will not need to know them directly. Still, you may have occasion in your future as a coder in which you will need to know more.
//  Browse through the Wikipedia page for sorting algorithms: 🔗https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm
//  This is an article with complicated computer science theory; you do not need to understand the entire history of computing after reading one Wiki page. Take notes in a comment in this challenge on what you do glean and learn about the different sorting algorithms as you skim through.
